                <p>The first real thing that I had to do using the arduino kit was create some basic circuits. We had
                    already learned about the parts of a circuit as well as Ohm's law in class, so this was an exercise
                    in putting what I learned into practice.
                </p>

                <h3>Babyâ€™s first circuit</h3>

                <p>The first cricut I had to make was a pretty simple one. It has one button that must be pressed to
                    turn the LED on. I gathered all my materials out of the bags to get started.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/HW1/supp.JPG" alt="Ardiuno HW">

                <p>Then I followed the video instructions to make the circuit. Starting by using the red wire for the 5v
                    and the black wire for the ground. From there I placed the button and the LED making sure the button
                    was the correct way. I then connected the button to the 5V power with a resistor to prevent the LED
                    from receiving too much voltage. From there, I used more wires to complete the circuit. I made sure
                    to connect the anode side of the LED to the incoming power, and the cathode side to the ground wire.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/HW1/rcf.JPG" alt="Ardiuno HW">

                <p>Then I plugged it in. And it worked! First circuit was a success.</p>

                <img src="../images/HW1/cb.gif" alt="Ardiuno HW">

                <p>I can see here from the drawing in the book how exactly the circuit works. The power comes from the
                    5V wire, then runs through a resistor which is connected to a button that does not complete the
                    circuit until pushed down on. It then flows to an LED light, then to the ground where the full
                    circuit is completed.
                </p>

                <h3>Series circuit</h3>

                <p>The second circuit I needed to make was a series circuit. As shown in this model here, it is similar
                    to the first one but has two buttons instead. The buttons are in a row meaning both buttons need to
                    be pushed down in order for the LED to light up.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/HW1/scd.JPG" alt="Ardiuno HW">

                <p>I slightly change the first circuit by adding another button, then using wires to complete the
                    circuit. Making sure to connect the cathode side of the LED to the ground and so on.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/HW1/scf.JPG" alt="Ardiuno HW">

                <p>Once again it worked exactly as intended by only lighting up when both buttons were pressed. If only
                    one button was pressed the circuit would not be complete and would not light up the LED. But when
                    both were pressed it lit up!
                </p>

                <h3>Parallel circuit
                </h3>

                <p>The last circuit I had to make was the parallel circuit. Like the series circuit, it also has two
                    buttons, but you don't have to push both buttons to get the LED to light up. As shown in the diagram
                    here, the circuit will be complete if at least one button is pressed.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/HW1/pcd.JPG" alt="Ardiuno HW">


                <p>I first connected the wires to make sure the first button created a loop. Then I connected the second
                    button and made sure that also created a full look for the electricity to flow through.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/HW1/pcf.JPG" alt="Ardiuno HW">

                <p>Circuit complete! Pressing either button down, or both buttons at the same time causes the LED to
                    light up exactly as it should.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion
                </h3>

                <p>This homework was very interesting because although I learned how circuits and their parts work in
                    class, it was a very different experience actually getting to make one myself. I feel like it helped
                    me understand how it worked a lot better than if I was just looking at pictures in textbooks.
